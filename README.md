# Simple-Lemonade-Stand
Got bored in class, so i wrote a lemonade stand game in python.
I've actually never worked with python before so this is my first time writing a real program in python

It's still very rough but maybe i'll continue working on it in the future idk lmao

Written and tested with Python 3.11.2
